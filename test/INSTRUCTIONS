To Run Tests
============
Build the translator (located in directory "turnt src")

Acquire JUnit and Hamcrest:
    wget http://search.maven.org/remotecontent?filepath=junit/junit/4.12/junit-4.12.jar

    wget https://hamcrest.googlecode.com/files/hamcrest-all-1.3.jar 

Depending on where you choose to put ANTLR, JUnit, Hamcrest you may have to
modify the relative paths of various libraries in run_test.sh

Run all tests
    ./run_test.sh

Run a particular test
    ./run_test.sh MyTest

To Write Tests
==============
Create a directory for each individual test
    mkdir MyTest

Write the turnt code you want tested in
    MyTest/MyTest.tt

Write the JUnit testing code in
    MyTest/MyTest.java

Consult the [JUnit Documentation](http://junit.org/) for details on how to
write tests. Note that test methods are annotated with @Test
Also note that the directory, turnt code, and JUnit test code all have the
same file name stem (e.g. MyTest) -- case matters!
